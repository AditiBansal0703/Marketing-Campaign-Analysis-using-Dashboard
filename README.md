# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-using-Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing consumer purchase behavior using a marketing dataset. The goal was to uncover insights into customer demographics, income levels, product preferences, and geographic trends. The final visualization was built as an interactive dashboard using Google Looker Studio to assist in strategic marketing decisions.

In today’s data-driven market, understanding customer behavior is critical.  
I started with a Jupyter Notebook for thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and wrapped it up with a clean, interactive **dashboard** that offers insights into:

- 💵 **Income & Purchase Trends**
- 🌍 **Geographic Distribution of Customers**
- 🍷 **Product-wise Sales Performance**
- 📊 **Demographic Patterns in Buying Behavior**
- 🔍 **Complaints and Customer Segmentation**
